void init(int N, int mId[], int mLocation[])
 

This function is called in the beginning of each test case.

N building IDs and the location of buildings are given.

There are no cases where the buildings are of the same ID and of the same location.

 

Parameters

  N: The number of buildings ( 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 )

 

  When it comes to all ‘i’s following the condition of (0 ≤ i ＜ N):

  mId[i]: The ID of Building i ( 1 ≤ mId[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000 )

  mLocation[i]: The location of Building i ( 1 ≤ mLocation[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000 )
 

int add(int mId, int mLocation)
 

This function adds a building whose ID is mId and location is mLocation.

If the ID already exists, this function does not add the building but changes its location.

There are no cases where mLocation is given the same as the location value of a different building.

 

Parameters

  mId: The Building ID ( 1 ≤ mId ≤ 1,000,000,000 )

  mLocation: The location of building ( 1 ≤ mLocation ≤ 1,000,000,000 )

 

Returns

  After adding a building or changing the location, return the total number of buildings.
 

int remove(int mStart, int mEnd)
 

This function removes all buildings whose locations are in the range from mStart to mEnd.

 

Parameters

  mStart: The starting point of the range to be removed ( 1 ≤ mStart ≤ 1,000,000,000 )

  mEnd: The end point of the range to be removed ( mStart ≤ mEnd ≤ 1,000,000,000 )

 

Returns

  After the removal, return the total number of buildings left.
 

int install(int M)
 

When installing all M base stations making the distance between the most adjacent base stations the longest among the buildings left, this function returns the distance between the most adjacent base stations.

There are no cases where the value of M is given larger than the number of buildings.

 

Parameters

  M: The number of base stations ( 2 ≤ M ≤ 2,000 )

 

Returns

  Return the maximum distance between the most adjacent base stations.
